# Tic-Tac-Tow-Gamme
Tic Tac Toe Game Project!

I've created a vibrant and interactive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

Here's a breakdown of what I've accomplished:

HTML: Structured the game board and interface elements for a clean, organized layout.

CSS: Designed a visually captivating neon theme, complete with dynamic animations and a responsive layout.

JavaScript: Implemented the game logic, allowing players to make moves, check for wins or draws, and restart the game with a single click.

This project enhances my front-end development skills, especially in creating interactive user interfaces.
